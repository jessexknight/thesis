Drawing on the insights from Chapter~\ref{sr},
this chapter details the development of
a compartmental model of heterosexual HIV transmission in eSwatini.
The model aims to capture key determinants of heterosexual transmission dynamics, including
sex work, numbers of sexual partners, levels of condom use, anal sex, and ART scale-up.
\par
The model was implemented in Python~v3.8.10 with Numpy~v1.22.2,
and solved numerically using 4th order Runge-Kutta \cite{Gill1951} using a timestep of 0.05 years.
Post-hoc analysis was conducted in R~v3.6.3.
All code and selected results are available on GitHub.%
