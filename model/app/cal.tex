\section{Model Calibration}\label{app.model.cal}
Table~\ref{tab:par.defs} gives the short names (used in code and results figures) and definitions
of the calibrated model parameters ($N = 73$).
The precise sampling distributions, constraints, and application of each parameter to define
the complete set of model inputs is available online:\\

\subsection{Relational Sampling Constraints}\label{app.model.cal.constr}
Several relational constraints were imposed on calibrated parameter values during sampling.
Incorporating constraints within Latin hypercube sampling is challenging \cite{Petelet2010}.
Thus, for each set of constraints below, the selected parameters
were sampled randomly (not via Latin hypercube) and repeated until all constraints were satisfied;
as noted in \sref{app.math.distr.jsam},
this sampling strategy effectively changes the prior distribution
to reflect both the original prior and the specified constraints.
