\section{Calibration}\label{model.cal}
The parameters described in \sref{model.par} represent model inputs, many of which are uncertain.
For each uncertain parameter, I have specified a prior distribution based on
the available data and/or assumptions.
Model calibration then aims to reduce this uncertainty
--- \ie estimate the parameter posterior distributions ---
by comparing model \emph{outputs} to additional data called ``calibration targets'',
under different combinations of input parameters.
Section~\ref{model.cal.appr} describes the approach to calibration, while
\sref{model.cal.targ} details the calibration targets used,
including estimates of HIV incidence, prevalence, and the cascade of care
for the population overall, and stratified by risk group where available.
