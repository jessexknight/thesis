\section{Calibration}\label{model.cal}
The parameters described in \sref{model.par} represent model inputs, many of which are uncertain.
For each uncertain parameter, I have specified a prior distribution based on
the available data and/or assumptions.
Model calibration then aims to reduce this uncertainty
--- \ie estimate the joint parameter posterior distribution ---
by comparing model \emph{outputs} to additional data called ``calibration targets'',
under different combinations of input parameters.
Section~\ref{model.cal.appr} describes the approach to calibration, while
\sref{model.cal.targ} details the calibration targets used,
including estimates of HIV incidence, prevalence, and the cascade of care
for the population overall, and stratified by risk group where available.
Results of model calibration are given in \sref{model.res}.
