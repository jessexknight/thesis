\section{Model Structure \& Notation}\label{model.str}
The model aims to capture heterosexual HIV transmission among the Swati population aged 15--49.
The model stratifies the modelled population along five dimensions, including:
2 sexes~($s$), 4 activity groups~($i$), 6 HIV states~($h$), and 5 cascade states~($c$);
the fifth dimension tracks seroconcordant \hivp partnerships
and includes strata for each of 4 partnership types ($p$) plus 1 extra stratum
--- see \sref{foi.prop} for full details.
In total, $2 \times 4 \times (1 + 5 \times 5 \times 5) = 2016$ states are modelled,
since the cascade and partnership dimensions are only applicable to PLHIV ($h>1$).
These dimensions are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:model.dims} and Figure~\ref{fig:model}.
Two types of sex acts ($a$) are also considered.

Sexual activity groups were defined to reflect
persistent differences in HIV incidence and prevalence
\cite{SDHS2006,Bicego2013,Justman2016,SHIMS2}
--- reflecting acquisition and/or onward transmission risk ---
as well as common stratifications in the available data,
and epidemiologically relevant sub-populations.
The lowest sexual activity group ($i=1$) comprises
individuals who had 0-1 sexual partners in the past 12 months (p12m),
but did not engage in sex work.
The medium activity group ($i=2$) similarly comprises
individuals who had 2+ sexual partners in p12m
but did not engage in formal sex work.
The highest two activity groups among women ($i=3,4$) comprise
lower and higher risk FSW (see \sref{model.par.fsw} for more details), and
the highest two activity groups among men ($i=3,4$) likewise comprise
lower and higher risk clients of FSW.

Four types of sexual partnerships are modelled,
with different levels of condom use and expected durations:
long-term/spousal partnerships ($p=1$, lowest condom use, 14--19 years);
short-term partnerships ($p=2$, medium condom use, 3--18 months);
one-off new/occasional sex work partnerships ($p=3$, highest condom use, 1 sex act);
and regular sex work partnerships ($p=4$, medium condom use, 2--24 months).
Figure~\ref{fig:model.risk} illustrates
the modelled activity groups and possible partnership types between them.

HIV infection is stratified into
acute-HIV and stages defined by CD4 count (Figure~\ref{fig:model.hiv})
to reflect changes in mortality~\cite{Mangal2017},
historical ART eligibility~\cite{EswMOH2006,EswMOH2010,EswMOH2015,EswMOH2018},
and, with CD4 as a proxy for viral load, infectiousness~\cite{Boily2009}.
The modelled ART cascade (Figure~\ref{fig:model.cascade})
includes the major steps associated with the ``90-90-90'' targets,
plus a generic ``virally un-suppressed'' state reflecting any combination of
treatment failure, discontinuation, or loss to follow-up after achieving viral suppression.
Loss to follow-up prior to viral suppression is not explicitly modelled,
but subsumed into the rates of ART initiation and viral suppression.

\paragraph{Notation}
If $X$ is a variable (\eg population, parameter, calibration target)
stratified by dimensions $a,b,c$,
then $X_{ab_{1}c_{23}}$ denotes the values of $X$ for
a particular but \emph{unspecified} stratum of $a$,
the \emph{specific} stratum $b = 1$,
and the \emph{aggregated} strata $c = 2,3$
(the aggregating operation is context-dependent, \eg sum for probabilities).
Additionally, the indices $sihc$ from Table~\ref{tab:model.dims} denote ``self'' strata,
whereas $s'i'h'c'$ denote ``other'' strata --- \ie individuals' partners.%
\footnote{\label{foot:code.note}%
  In the code: R uses one-based indexing, which match the notation here directly,
  while Python uses zero-based indexing, which therefore appear as $i \rightarrow i-1$ in the code.
  Also, the model code reorders states in the ART Cascade dimension for computational efficiency,
  with $c={}$1:~Undiagnosed; 2:~Diagnosed; 3:~Virally~Un-suppressed; 4:~On~ART; 5:~Virally~Suppressed.}
Finally, I re-use several dummy variables throughout the chapter:
$\rho$ for proportions, $\lambda$ for rates, $T$ for time periods, and $f$ for constants.
