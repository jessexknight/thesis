\section{Parameterization}\label{model.par}
Model parameterization involves specification of parameter values (model inputs),
such as proportions, probabilities, rates, and ratios.
These parameters are used to define
the initial conditions and rates of transition between modelled states.
Some transition rates are fixed, such as rates of progression through HIV infection stages,
while other transition rates vary with time, such as rates of HIV diagnosis and ART initiation.
The transition rate for susceptible-to-infected --- \ie \emph{transmission} ---
is defined by a complex ``force of infection'' equation which mechanistically integrates
biological, behavioural, and interventional determinants of transmission;
Chapter~\ref{foi} develops this equation in detail,
including modifications to overcome limitations of prior equations.
\par
The true values of many parameters are uncertain due to several potential sources of error.
Thus, prior distributions are specified for 73 parameters (Table~\ref{tab:par.defs}),
and the joint posterior distributions of these uncertain parameters are then inferred
via model calibration, as described in \sref{model.cal}~and~\ref{model.res}.
Proportions and probabilities were generally modelled using
a beta approximation of the binomial distribution (BAB, see \sref{app.model.math.bab}),
while rates and ratios were generally modelled using
a gamma, skewnormal, or inverse gaussian distribution to guarantee positive values.
