\section{Parameterization}\label{model.par}
As described in \sref{intro.model.param}, model parameterization involves
specification of model parameter values, such as proportions, probabilities, rates, and ratios,
including stratified values to reflect heterogeneity,
and sampling distributions to reflect uncertainty.
Proportions and probabilities were generally modelled using
a beta approximation of the binomial distribution (BAB, see \sref{app.math.distr.bab}),
while rates and ratios were generally modelled using
a gamma, skewnormal, or inverse gaussian distribution.
\paragraph{Notation}
If $X$ is a parameter stratified by dimensions $a,b,c$,
then $X_{ab_{1}c_{23}}$ denotes the values of $X$ for
a particular but \emph{unspecified} stratum of $a$,
the \emph{specific} stratum $b = 1$,
and the \emph{aggregated} strata $c = 2,3$
(the aggregating operation is context-dependent, \eg sum for probabilities).
Additionally, the indices $sihc$ from Table~\ref{tab:model.dims} denote ``self'' strata,
whereas $s'i'h'c'$ denote ``other'' strata --- \ie individuals' partners.%
\footnote{\label{foot:code.note}%
  In the code: R uses one-based indexing, which match the notation here directly,
  while Python uses zero-based indexing, which therefore appear as $i \rightarrow i-1$ in the code.
  Also, the model code reorders states in the ART Cascade dimension for computational efficiency,
  with $c={}$1:~Undiagnosed; 2:~Diagnosed; 3:~Virally~Un-suppressed; 4:~On~ART; 5:~Virally~Suppressed.}
Finally, I re-use several dummy variables throughout the chapter:
$\rho$ for proportions, $\lambda$ for rates, $T$ for time periods, and $f$ for constants.
