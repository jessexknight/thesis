I would also like to acknowledge the lands on which I worked to produce this thesis.
These lands include the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territories of the
Mississaugas of the Credit, Chippewa, Huron-Wendat, Seneca, % Toronto
Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee, % Kingston
and Musqueam peoples. % Vancouver
These places are still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island,
and I am grateful to have the opportunity to live, learn, and work on these lands.

Finally, I would like to reflect and comment on my positionality with respect to HIV research and practice.
My lived experience is shaped by many dimensions of privilege, including being
white, male, cisgender, heterosexual, and English-speaking.
I was born and raised in a highly supportive upper middle class Canadian family,
and I have had numerous opportunities to travel, learn, and follow my interests.
I recognize that my lived experiences are, in fact, quite distant from those that
afford a deeper understanding of the HIV epidemic, in Eswatini and elsewhere.
I have never been to Eswatini and only travelled to Sub-Saharan Africa once,
for two months in 2015 as part of the Engineering World Health Summer Institute in Rwanda.
I have never delivered health services,
though I am fortunate to work with many who have.
\par
Nevertheless I am inspired by
people living with HIV, families, friends,
brave leaders and advocates of marginalized communities,
healthcare providers and public health professionals
who have been fighting for decades against HIV.
I believe that these efforts can end the HIV epidemic in our lifetime,
provided they remain responsive to emergent risks and persistent prevention gaps.
I believe that these risks and gaps can be difficult to identify and are easily overlooked,
but that they often derive from intersecting upstream inequities.
I believe that quantitative data about these inequities
cannot be understood without qualitative insights,
and that the benefits of addressing these inequities
extend beyond biomedical definitions of wellness.
Thus, while my thesis highlights the importance of
HIV prevention for female sex workers and their clients in Eswatini,
I perceive this work as part of broader efforts to
maintain health equity at the fore of the HIV epidemic response.
