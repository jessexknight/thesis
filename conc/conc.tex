\section{Conclusion}\label{conc.conc}
Compartmental HIV transmission models continue to guide
the policy and programmatic response to HIV at global, national, and local scales.
These models provide indispensable insights through
mechanistic inference of epidemiological variables and
uncertainty-informed comparison of intervention scenarios.
The utility of these models is therefore rooted in their ability to reflect
--- via modelling assumptions ---
the best available knowledge of current epidemic drivers and prevention gaps.
Thus, routine and rigorous reexamination of modelling assumptions
should remain a pillar of applied modelling,
while the potential harms of flawed assumptions should be kept top-of-mind.
